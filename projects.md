# Projects

## Placing Pipeline (ELPIS Lab)
**Stack:** Python, OpenCV, RealSense, RANSAC  
**Problem.** Robots need reliable, collision-free placement strategies for manipulation tasks.  
**Solution.** Designed a placement pipeline using Intel RealSense depth data + OpenCV segmentation. Implemented RANSAC-based plane fitting, background subtraction, depth masking, and non-maximal suppression to find stable placement locations.  
**Result.** Delivered a validated prototype tested on real cameras, forming the basis for future lab experiments with safe, scalable placement planning.

## Romi Trash-Collection Robots
**Stack:** C/C++, Embedded Systems, AprilTags, Sensors  
**Problem.** Simulate real-world waste collection using small autonomous robots.  
**Solution.** Programmed Romi robots to retrieve 3D-printed trash bins from a grid using line-following at intersections and AprilTag detection. Integrated encoder feedback, reflectance arrays, and IMU sensing for robust navigation and handling.  
**Result.** Robots successfully collected and delivered bins in real-world tests, demonstrating reliable coordination of navigation, perception, and object handling.

## UR10 Robotic Arm — Camera Mount & Calibration
**Stack:** SolidWorks, Hand–Eye Calibration, RealSense, UR10  
**Problem.** Accurate perception required for reliable UR10 manipulator pick-and-place experiments.  
**Solution.** Designed and fabricated a dual-angle camera mount in SolidWorks. Performed hand–eye calibration using fiducial tags to align robot and camera frames.  
**Result.** Achieved calibrated UR10 + RealSense setup with improved object localization, enabling higher-accuracy manipulation tasks.

## Fruit-Picking Autonomous Mobile Robot
**Stack:** Python, Embedded Control, Team Design  
**Problem.** Automate harvesting tasks by navigating an environment and sorting fruit-like objects.  
**Solution.** Collaborated on robot design and programming. Implemented linear navigation, tree alignment, approach logic, fruit recognition, and delivery to correct baskets.  
**Result.** Built and tested an autonomous system capable of navigating obstacles, recognizing targets, and performing task-specific object sorting.
